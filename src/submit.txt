Brief Description:

A simple turn-based board game, where you have to roll a sphere around.

How you met the technical requirements (code re-use, scrolling message, VM):

The file demo.c is what was left from the original one.. and it's still slightly
over 2 pages. (I had to split it into 3 functions and slightly modified it to
draw bigger stars, but yes, it's the starfield code from the original demo.) I
also re-used the MIDI file from the demo, if that counts.. And i re-used Shawn's
complete EGG, so lots of code-reuse :)

Well, for the other 2.. see the scrolling message at the start? And the EGG
interpreter sure is a VM, even a damn good one :)

How you met the artistic requirements (nuclear radiation):

The main 'character' of the game itself is a nuclear uranum sphere, and do you
see how it's radiating?

Hm, and I also made an act of goat.. a goat promoting my game.. not sure if
I interpreted that right though..

Other comments:

Somehow I feel bad for also doing the 2nd weekend, I postponed lots of work and
coded another entry instead.. but I enjoyed it :)
